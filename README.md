A demonstration to what vanila CSS is capable of
@@==================================================================@@

This project I created manily for demonstration purposes with no reusability in mind. 
CSS alone is a great design language if you can master everything out of it. Generally, inspiration comes from the nature itself. And
often we imitate it by some means. In graphic sense, to recreate what we see around us we vastly rely on things like canvas API,
WebGL or OpenGL. Of course photoshop exits, but it's not in the realm of web.

In this project, you can see 4 beautiful demonstration. Hope you like it.
